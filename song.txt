That was you upon the mountain
All alone and all surrounded
Walking on the ground you're breaking
Laughing at the life you're wasting
One, two, a jive won't do it
You do it on your left
And you'll never get through it
Everything you'll have to see
Dinner isn't just one day
Good try, we don't like it
Good try, we won't take that shit
Oh, I can't win
